There are a few steps you can take to create a Chrome extension that records the screen and saves the recording:

First, you'll need to use the Chrome Extension API to access the screen recording functionality of the browser. You can do this by using the chrome.desktopCapture API and requesting access to the user's screen.

Next, you'll need to use a library or API to actually 
record the screen.
One popular library for this is the MediaRecorder API,
which is built into most modern browsers.

Once you have access to the screen recording functionality 
and have started the recording, you'll need to handle the
data that is generated. You can use the ondataavailable
event to access the data as it is generated, and 
then use the save method to save the recording to a file.

Finally, you'll need to package your extension and submit
it to the Chrome Web Store so that other users can install
and use it.

Please note that Google is strict on the use of screen 
recording in extensions so you will need to check the 
developer policies for this feature before proceeding.
